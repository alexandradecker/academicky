These disparities are believed to influence reward sensitivity, which in turn are hypothesized to shape how individuals respond to and pursue rewarding experiences. However, surprisingly little is known about how SES shapes reward sensitivity in adolescence. Here, we investigated how SES influenced adolescent responses to reward, both in behavior and the striatum—a brain region that is highly sensitive to reward. We examined responses to both immediate reward (tracked by phasic dopamine) and average reward rate fluctuations (tracked by tonic dopamine) as these distinct signals independently shape learning and motivation. Adolescents (n = 114; 12–14 years; 58 female) performed a gambling task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We manipulated trial-by-trial reward and loss outcomes, leading to fluctuations between periods of reward scarcity and abundance. We found that a higher reward rate hastened behavioral responses, and increased guess switching, consistent with the idea that reward abundance increases response vigor and exploration. Moreover, immediate reward reinforced previously rewarding decisions (win–stay, lose–switch) and slowed responses (postreward pausing), particularly when rewards were scarce. Notably, lower-SES adolescents slowed down less after rare rewards than higher-SES adolescents. In the brain, striatal activations covaried with the average reward rate across time and showed greater activations during rewarding blocks. However, these striatal effects were diminished in lower-SES adolescents. These findings show that the striatum tracks reward rate fluctuations, which shape decisions and motivation. Moreover, lower SES appears to attenuate reward-driven behavioral and brain responses.","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Striatal and Behavioral Responses to Reward Vary by Socioeconomic Status in Adolescents (2024)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra Decker","Katherine Duncan","Amy Finn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701129600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701129600,"objectID":"12de76b4f318ff60166d84a286a4e8e9","permalink":"/publication/2023_psych_science/","publishdate":"2023-11-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_psych_science/","section":"publication","summary":"Why do children’s memories often differ from adults’ after the same experience? Whereas prior work has focused on immature memory mechanisms to answer this question, here we focus on the costs of attentional lapses for learning. We track sustained attention and memory formation across time in 7- to 10-year-old children and adults (n = 120) to show that sustained attention causally shapes the fate of children’s individual memories. Moreover, children’s attention lapsed twice as frequently as adults’, and attention fluctuated with memory formation more closely in children than adults. In addition, although attentional lapses impaired memory for expected events in both childre and adults, they impaired memory for unexpected events in children only. Our work reveals that sustained attention is an important cognitive factor that controls access to children’s long-term memory stores. Our work also raises the possibility that developmental differences in cognitive performance stem from developmental shifts in the ability to sustain attention.","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Fluctuations in Sustained Attention Explain Moment-to-Moment Shifts in Children’s Memory Formation (2023)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra Decker","Michael Dubois","Katherine Duncan","Amy Finn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701129600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701129600,"objectID":"9de681348e9b8c9bfd14eeb1eaa9d0e6","permalink":"/publication/2023_psychonomic/","publishdate":"2023-11-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023_psychonomic/","section":"publication","summary":"Attentional lapses have been found to impair everything from basic perception to learning and memory. Yet, despite the well documented costs of lapses on cognition, recent work suggests that lapses might unexpectedly confer some benefits. One potential benefit is that lapses broaden our learning to integrate seemingly irrelevant content that could later prove useful–a benefit that prior research focusing only on goal- relevant memory would miss. Here, we measure how fluctuations in sustained attention influence the learning of seemingly goal irrelevant content that competes for attention with target content. Participants completed a correlated flanker task in which they categorized central targets (letters or numbers) while ignoring peripheral flanking symbols that shared hidden probabilistic relationships with the targets. We found that across participants, higher rates of attentional lapses correlated with greater learning of the target-flanker relationships. Moreover, within participants, learning was more evident during attentional lapses. These findings address long-standing theoretical debates and reveal a benefit of attentional lapses. That is, they expand the scope of learning and decisions beyond the strictly relevant","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Pay Attention and you might miss it Greater learning during attentional lapses (2023)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra Decker","Amy Finn*","Katherine Duncan*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1600905600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600905600,"objectID":"21960ca6e943a2a00c5cb6b74dedf103","permalink":"/publication/mistakes-learning-paper/","publishdate":"2020-09-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mistakes-learning-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Making an error triggers a host of cognitive and behavioral adjustments theorized to boost task engagement and facilitate learning. Yet how errors influence memory formation – a cognitive process foundational to learning – remains unknown. Adaptive cognitive accounts of error processing propose that errors increase arousal, taskengagement, and attention, and should therefore enhance subsequent memory formation. Conversely, nonadaptive accounts of error processing and related research in arousal-mediated memory selectivity predict that errors could impair subsequent memory formation. We tested these divergent predictions in two experiments. In experiment 1, participants categorized trial-unique images as ‘living’ or ‘nonliving’, and following a short delay, performed a surprise recognition memory task. In contrast to what adaptive cognitive accounts of error processing would predict, people formed memories more poorly after errors, even when performance after errors was accurate. In experiment 2, we asked whether poorer memory formation after errors correlated with arousal or visual engagement after errors. Participants performed a modified Simon task in which they categorized trialunique images as ‘natural’ or ‘man-made’, while we recorded pupil dilation and visual fixations. Recognition memory was subsequently tested. We found that people who encoded memories more poorly after errors had larger pupillary responses to errors and spent less time fixating on stimuli after errors relative to before. Our results support non-adaptive theories of error processing by showing that errors transiently impair memory formation, possibly by increasing arousal and capturing attention.","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Errors lead to transient impairments in memory formation (2020)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra Decker","Katherine Duncan*","Amy Finn*","Donald Mabbott*"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1597190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597190400,"objectID":"cd37169e689e67aecbf744ccc52c8b77","permalink":"/publication/income-cognitive-dev-paper/","publishdate":"2020-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/income-cognitive-dev-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Children from lower income backgrounds tend to have poorer memory and language abilities than their wealthier peers.

We find that anterior (but not posterior) hippocampal volumes positively correlate with family income up to an annual income of ~$75,000. Income-related differences in the anterior (but not posterior) hippocampus also predicted the strength of the gaps in] memory and language. These findings add anatomical specificity to current theories by suggesting a stronger relationship between family income and anterior than posterior hippocampal volumes and offer a potential mechanism through which children from different income homes differ cognitively.","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Children’s family income is associated with cognitive function and volume of anterior not posterior hippocampus (2020)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra Decker","Katherine Duncan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9f3173e66b9fe45d76f042e0cc382e4b","permalink":"/publication/acetylcholine-attention-memory-paper/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/acetylcholine-attention-memory-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Long-standing theories propose that acetylcholine biases memory by slowly shifting hippocampal dynamics to favor encoding or retrieval. However, recent characterizations of acetylcholine functions across multiple spatiotemporal scales suggest that its mnemonic influence is both broader in space, coordinating networks of regions, and narrower in time, having precisely timed consequences, than traditionally thought. Integrating this work, we review evidence for synchronous acetylcholine release across the hippocampus and neocortex, which could favor the encoding of attended and well represented content during high-cholinergic states. Conversely, we propose that lower acetylcholine levels thought to benefit spontaneous hippocampal retrieval conflict with the high cortical levels necessary for attention-dependent aspects of recollection. We propose that rapid cholinergic mechanisms and neural oscillations may resolve these conflicting retrieval demands.","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Acetylcholine and the complex interdependence of memory and attention (2020)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cynthia B. de Medeiros","Iska Moxon-Emre","Nadia Scantlebury","David Malkin","Vijay Ramaswamy","Alexandra Decker","Nicole Law","Toshihiro Kumabe","Jeffrey Leonard","Josh Rubin","Shin Jung","Seung-Ki Kim","Nalin Gupta","William Weiss","Claudia C.

To push our limits and attend for longer when our mind wants to wander.\nAt the end of a long day, the battle to pay attention can feel like a battle between slave and slave driver.\nIn the movie Limitless, a struggling writer tries to win this battle against the limit on his own mental capacities by taking a drug that enhances his attention. He rises to the top of his game and has opportunities to make loads of money. He can now encode new knowledge and retrieve information at an unprecedented rate.\nLike in the movie Limitless, we show that heightened attention augments our mental capacities, allowing us to encode and retrieve information easily. You can read our paper here: As attention waxes and wanes across time, so too does our ability to learn from our experiences. Based on our findings, people with better sustained attention capacities should learn and retrieve information faster than those who can’t.\nBut is this always the case? Are people who overcome their attentional limits better learners?\nCounterintuitively, the answer is no.\nIn fact, memory consolidation, reinforcing our memories for long-term storage, takes place during rest and sleep when arousal and attention are operating at low levels. So without periods of rest, it would be difficult to consolidate our memories. You can read more about how memory works during different vigilant and relaxed attentional states by reading our paper here:\nSecond, some types of learning operate better when we’re not concentrating so damn hard. In fact, detaching our attention from the most important information allows our eyes and minds to drift where they will, where we may notice patterns that go unnoticed by others who only pay attention to what’s most relevant to a task at hand.\nWe recently showed that fluctuations in attention increase our sensitivity to patterns that aren’t explicitly obvious. We can then use these patterns to our benefit. Therefore, while heightened attentional states allow us readily to attend to and encode what seems important at the moment, maintaining this state forever might hurt us in the long run. Just like the struggling writer finds in the movie Limitless.\nSo don’t fret when your mind wanders. If you let it, you might end up learning something important.\n","date":1572134400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572134400,"objectID":"4ebeed941c110952462306da0fb2e957","permalink":"/project/attention/","publishdate":"2019-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/attention/","section":"project","summary":"The virtues and perversions of attention","tags":["Attentional states"],"title":"Why loosening the grip on attention can help you learn more","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Refinement of this treatment has greatly improved survival rates in this patient population. However, radiotherapy also profoundly affects the developing brain and is associated with reduced hippocampal volume and blunted hippocampal neurogenesis.Such hippocampal (as well as extrahippocampal) abnormalities likely contribute to cognitive impairments in this population. While several aspects of memory have been examined in this population, the impact of radiotherapy on autobiographical memory has not previously been evaluated. Here we evaluated autobiographical memory in male and female patients who received radiotherapy for posterior fossa tumors (PFTs), includin gmedulloblastoma, during childhood. Using the Children’s Autobiographical Interview, we retrospectively assessed episodic and nonepisodic details for events that either preceded (i.e., remote) or followed (i.e., recent) treatment. For post-treatment events, PFT patients reportedfewer episodic details compared with control subjects. For pretreatment events, PFT patients reported equivalent episodic details compared with control subjects. In a range of conditions associated with reduced hippocampal volume (including medial temporal lobe amnesia, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer’s disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, transient epileptic amnesia, frontal temporal dementia, traumatic brain injury, encephalitis, and aging), loss of episodic details (even in remote memories) accompanies hippocampal volume loss. It istherefore surprisingthat pretreatment episodic memories in PFT patients with reduced hippocampal volume are retained. We discuss these findings in light of the anterograde and retrograde impact on memory of experimentally suppressing hippocampal neurogenesis in rodents.","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Impaired recent, but preserved remote, autobiographical memory in pediatric brain tumor patients (2018)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ade Oyefiade","Stephanie Ameis","Jason Lerch","Conrad Rockel","Kamila Szulc","Nadia Scantlebury","Alexandra Decker","Jaleel Jefferson","Simon Spichak","Donald Mabbott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"7d5d27719172d836ac9ef71cfecc8ff7","permalink":"/publication/u-fibres-paper/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/u-fibres-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Neural communication is facilitated by intricate networks of white matter (WM) comprised of both long and short range connections. The maturation of long range WM connections has been extensively characterized, with projection, commissural, and association tracts showing unique trajectories with age. There, however, remains a limited understanding of age-related changes occurring within short range WM connections, or U-fibers. These connections are important for local connectivity within lobes and facilitate regional cortical function and greater network economy. Recent studies have explored the maturation of U-fibers primarily using cross-sectional study designs. Here, we analyzed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data for healthy children and adolescents in both a cross-sectional (n = 78; mean age = 13.04 ± 3.27 years) and a primarily longitudinal (n = 26; mean age = 10.78 ± 2.69 years) cohort. We found significant age-related differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) across the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes of participants within the cross-sectional cohort. By contrast, we report significant age-related differences in only FA for participants within the longitudinal cohort. Specifically, larger FA values were observed with age in frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes of the left hemisphere. Our results extend previous findings restricted to long range WM to demonstrate regional changes in the microstructure of short range WM during childhood and adolescence. These changes possibly reflect continued myelination and axonal organization of short range WM with increasing age in more anterior regions of the left hemisphere.","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Development of short-range white matter in healthy children and adolescents (2018)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra Decker","Kamila Szulc","Eric Bouffet","Suzanne Laughlin","Jovanka Skocic","Cynthia de Medieros","Donald Mabbott"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"7ed5fedd349e165d4a9613529d7179f4","permalink":"/publication/subfield-paper/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/subfield-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"The developing hippocampus is highly sensitive to chemotherapy and cranial radiation treatments for pediatric cancers, yet little is known about the effects that cancer treatents have on specific hippocampal subfields. Here, we examined hippocampal subfield volumes in 29 pediatric brain tumor survivors treated with cranial radiation and chemotherapy, and 30 healthy developing children and adolescents. We also examined associations between hippocampal subfield volumes and short-term verbal memory. Hippocampal subfields (Cornus Ammonis (CA) 1, CA2-3, dentate gyrus (DG)-CA4, stratum radiatum—lacunosum—moleculare, and subiculum) were segmented using the Multiple Automatically Generated Templates for Different Brains automated segmentation algorithm. Neuropsychological assessment of short-term verbal associative memory was performed in a subset of brain tumor survivors (N = 11) and typically developing children (N = 16), using the Children's Memory Scale or Wechsler's Memory Scale—third edition. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that pediatric brain tumor survivors had significantly smaller DG-CA4, CA1, CA2-3, and stratum radiatum-lacunosum-moleculare volumes compared with typically developing children. Verbal memory performance was positively related to DG-CA4, CA1, and stratum radiatum-lacunosum-moleculare volumes in pediatric brain tumor survivors. Unlike the brain tumor survivors, there were no associations between subfield volumes and memory in typically developing children and adolescents. These data suggest that specific subfields of the hippocampus may be vulnerable to brain cancer treatments, and may contribute to impaired episodic memory following brain cancer treatment in childhood.","tags":["Publications"],"title":"Smaller hippocampal subfield volumes predict verbal associative memory in pediatric brain tumor survivors (2017)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.
