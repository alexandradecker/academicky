Hi there! I'm Lexi, a postdoc at MIT. I research dynamic changes in attention, learning, and memory across time. I want to understand why it is sometimes hard and other times easy to attend, learn, and remember. I'm interesting in understanding the factors that influence cognitive states. By deciphering the factors that modulate cognitive processes in each moment, I aim to develop methods to improve cognition in both healthy and clinical samples.
