I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Toronto working with <a href="http://duncanlab.org/index.php/people/">Katherine Duncan</a> and <a href="https://finnlandlab.org/">Amy Finn</a>. I’m curious about the brain mechanisms that support attention and learning as well as how attentional and motivational states influence learning. I’m also interested in how learning and attention mechanisms differ as a result of brain structure, age, experience, and environmental contexts. Get in touch if you'd like to chat about ideas or collaborate! Find more details about my research by looking through my site, or {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" %}} downloading my CV{{% /staticref %}}.
