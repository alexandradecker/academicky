I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Toronto working with <a href="http://duncanlab.org/index.php/people/">Katherine Duncan</a> and <a href="https://finnlandlab.org/">Amy Finn</a>. I'm curious about how and why paying attention in pursuit of our short- and long-term goals is challenging, and how different attentional states affect learning and memory. I'm also curious about how cognitive processes involved in attention and memory change with age, experience, and socioeconomic status. Get in touch if you'd like to chat about ideas or collaborate!
