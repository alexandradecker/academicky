# To do stuff!

When make changes, go to add ins --> serve site to check out how changes look


git add -A (to add stuff)
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master
serve site (addins)

- the above should update the public folder which is what public sees, which is what is pushed to github; it sits on github; Netlify then takes what is on github and hosts the content on my website. 


build website (right side)


- use pad token to sign into github if prompted in my last pass

## Adding Publications:
- to add publication, add publication folder to context, copy ad paste index file from another publication folder and update that content (abstract etc); to add pdf, copy and paste pdf into that folder and make it the same name as the folder and it will automatically update.

The site is hosted by netlify: I can go to netlify and log in using github; I can also push to publish my site from there too.
