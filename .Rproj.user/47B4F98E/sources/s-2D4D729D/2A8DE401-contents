I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Toronto working with <a href="http://duncanlab.org/index.php/people/">Katherine Duncan</a> and <a href="https://finnlandlab.org/">Amy Finn</a>. My research here focuses on why it's sometimes difficult to sustain attention on our goals, what factors promote better sustained attention, and how sustained attention abilities correlate with different types of learning.
